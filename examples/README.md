## Examples

### Shell Scripts

1. `student_dir.sh` - the example from the course notes.

### R

1. [vectorize_ex1.R](./vectorize_ex1.R): In this example, 
   we carry out a small Monte Carlo study investigating the
   coverage of nominal confidence intervals.
   
1. [vectorize_ex2.R](./vectorize_ex2.R): Compares loops and vectorized 
   approaches to computing row variances.

1. [vectorize_ex3.R](./vectorize_ex3.R): Compares different ways of computing 
   the correlation coefficient between a target variable "yvec" and each of a
   collection "xmat" of others.

1. [secret_class.R](./secret_class.R): S3 method dispatch, from Ch 13 in 
   advanced R.
