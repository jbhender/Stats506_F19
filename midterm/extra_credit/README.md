## Midterm, Extra Credit

This folder contains files related to the midterm extra credit.
There are four questions on the midterm extra credit, but there
are no files here related to question 4, part d.  For the other three
see the descriptions below.

### Question 2, Part c

The folder `q2_partc` contains a collection of files against which you can test your
solution. A proper solution, when run in a directory containing these files, will
display the results seen in `lines_to_change.txt`.

### Question 5

The folder `q5` contains a suite of tests you can use to test your solution.  
The output of these tests is captured in `lines_to_change.txt`.

### Question 6

The folder `q6` contains a script `fall_classic.R` on which question 6 was based.
The same three `<task(s)>` remain. Work to make your solution, especially to 
`<task1>`, as simple and efficient as possible. After you have a solution in hand,
consider what minimal context would have allow you to answer the question.
